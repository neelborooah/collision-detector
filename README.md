# collision-detector
Detecting incoming collisions and generating possible avoidance strategies

For this PoC I will be building a simple client side web app.

Given a stationary point A and a moving point B, I need to figure out if B's trajectory will lead to a collision with A.

Right now, I am still figuring out the way to approach this problem. I will be using Javascript and a web page to visually represent the computation.
